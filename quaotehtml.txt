  <p>Mentioning mobile EHR products, this is what Doug Brown, Managing Partner of Black Book Market Research, had to say:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"As the transition to mobile devices has been rapidly occurring over the past five years, progressive EHR vendors have responded with clear plans and successful products to help expand the user experience. With more than half of physicians currently using a mobile device in their medical practices, these EHR vendors are allowing providers to choose which platform best fits in to their workflow in multiple healthcare delivery settings including highly usable mobile products."</p>
  </blockquote>
